### Added all functionality of a normal 2048 game

- last time I played this game was eons ago so dont sue me if I forget edge cases or sth :P
- Make it headless/head(ed?), change bool HEADLESS in config. If headless, the Matrix will show in terminal

## How to run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Notes:

- Time taken for each movement operation is ~0.004 seconds at O(1) complexity
